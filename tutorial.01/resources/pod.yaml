# Create a pod containing the PHP-FPM application (app)
# and nginx, each mounting the `app` volume to their
# respective /var/www/html directories.

  volumes:
    # Create the shared files volume to be used in both pods
    - name: volume
      emptyDir: {}

    # Add the ConfigMap we declared above as a volume for the pod
    - name: tut01-nginx-volume

  containers:
    # Our PHP-FPM application

      volumeMounts:
        - name: volume
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      # Important! After this container has started, the PHP files
      # in our Docker image aren't in the shared volume. We need to
      # get them into the shared volume. If we tried to write directly
      # to this volume from our Docker image the files wouldn't appear
      # in the nginx container.
      #
      # So, after the container has started, copy the PHP files from this
      # container's local filesystem (/app -- added via the Docker image)
      # to the shared volume, which is mounted at /var/www/html.
